Dear Ms. Peters, <br><br>
I read your job advertisement for the temporary position of Production Scheduler for Materials Procurement with great interest and would like to apply for this position. Although the position is time-limited, I am convinced that I can use and develop my skills and knowledge effectively. <br><br>
I have extensive experience in production and have deepened my knowledge of operational processes and procedures. While I have no direct experience in materials procurement, I am confident that I possess the necessary skills and qualities to be successful in this position. As a dedicated and motivated employee, I can quickly adapt to new work areas and overcome challenges. <br><br>
In addition, I have extensive experience in using Excel and have an excellent ability to analyze and process complex data. During my work in production, I also gained extensive experience in working with SAP, which makes me familiar with its functions and processes and I feel confident in using it. Furthermore, I have good PC skills and have extensively studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These programming languages are my passion, and I learn quickly. <br><br>
I am convinced that I can use my experience effectively and contribute to materials procurement to work effectively and efficiently. I am always eager to develop further and expand my skills to meet the requirements of my work optimally. <br><br>
I would be pleased to show you in a personal interview that I have the necessary qualities and skills to be successful as a Production Scheduler for Materials Procurement in your company. Thank you for your attention, and I am available for such an interview. <br><br>
Best regards
