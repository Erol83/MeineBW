          Dear Ms. Peters, <br><br>
I read your job posting for the temporary position of Production Scheduler for Material Procurement with great interest, and I hereby apply for this position. Although this position is temporary, I am convinced that I can use and develop my skills and knowledge effectively. I bring extensive experience in production and have deepened my knowledge of operational processes. <br><br>
Although I have not yet had direct experience in material procurement, I am confident that I possess the necessary skills and qualities to be successful in this position. I am a dedicated and motivated employee who can quickly adapt to new work areas and master challenges.<br><br>
While my Excel skills may be a bit rusty, I am confident that I can quickly refresh and expand my knowledge. I am highly motivated to further my education in this area and would welcome the opportunity to refresh my Excel skills at your company.<br><br>
During my work in production, I gained extensive experience in working with SAP, which has made me familiar with its functions and processes and feel confident in using it. In addition, I have good PC skills and have already delved deeply into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These programming languages are my passion, and I approach tasks with great motivation.<br><br>
I am convinced that I can use my experience effectively and contribute to material procurement to work efficiently and effectively. I am always eager to develop and expand my skills to meet the demands of my work optimally.<br><br>
I would be happy to show you in a personal conversation that I possess the necessary qualities and skills to be successful as a Production Scheduler for Material Procurement in your company. Thank you for your attention, and I am available for such a conversation.<br><br>
Best regards
